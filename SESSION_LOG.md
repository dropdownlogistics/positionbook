SESSION: Establish governance files (STD-DDL-REPO-OPS-001) up-to-code pass
AGENT:   Claude Code (claude-opus-4-8) — Amos Sayer / DDL Repo Auditor
SCOPE:   Repo root — SESSION_LOG.md and CHANGELOG.md established.

COMMITS:
  b741dfa  chore(auth): remove Clerk — public demo, no auth
  (this)   chore(governance): establish SESSION_LOG + CHANGELOG per STD-DDL-REPO-OPS-001

DONE:
  - Established SESSION_LOG.md and CHANGELOG.md per STD-DDL-REPO-OPS-001 (repo previously lacked them).
  - Clerk auth removed earlier this session; repo is now a public demo with no sign-in.

FLAGS / OPEN ITEMS:
  - @clerk/nextjs still in package.json (lockfile safety); zero code imports. npm uninstall deferred.
  - Design-conformance (fonts / breakpoints / colors) pending STD-DDL-DESIGN v3.0; see
    ddl-operations CONFORMANCE-SCORECARD-20260723.
